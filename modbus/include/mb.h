 * This module defines the interface for the application. It contains
 * the basic functions and types required to use the Modbus protocol stack.
 * A typical application will want to call eMBInit() first. If the device
 * is ready to answer network requests it must then call eMBEnable() to activate
 * the protocol stack. In the main loop the function eMBPoll() must be called
 * periodically. The time interval between pooling depends on the configured
 * Modbus timeout. If an RTOS is available a separate task should be created
 * and the task should always call the function eMBPoll().
 *
 * \code
 * // Initialize protocol stack in RTU mode for a slave with address 10 = 0x0A
 * eMBInit( MB_RTU, 0x0A, 38400, MB_PAR_EVEN );
 * // Enable the Modbus Protocol Stack.
 * eMBEnable(  );
 * for( ;; )

 *     // Call the main polling loop of the Modbus protocol stack.

/*! \ingroup modbus
 * \brief Initialize the Modbus protocol stack.
 *
 * This functions initializes the ASCII or RTU module and calls the
 * init functions of the porting layer to prepare the hardware. Please
 * note that the receiver is still disabled and no Modbus frames are
 * processed until eMBEnable( ) has been called.
 *
 * \param xInstance The pointer to instance struct.
 * \param xMBCallbacks The pointer to struct containing Modbus callbacks.
 * \param eMode If ASCII or RTU mode should be used.
 * \param ucSlaveAddress The slave address. Only frames sent to this
 *   address or to the broadcast address are processed.
 * \param ucPort The port to use. E.g. 1 for COM1 on windows. This value
 *   is platform dependent and some ports simply choose to ignore it.
 * \param ulBaudRate The baudrate. E.g. 19200. Supported baudrates depend
 *   on the porting layer.
 * \param eParity Parity used for serial transmission.
 *
 * \return If no error occurs the function returns eMBErrorCode::MB_ENOERR.
 *   The protocol is then in the disabled state and ready for activation
 *   by calling eMBEnable( ). Otherwise one of the following error codes
 *   is returned:
 *    - eMBErrorCode::MB_EINVAL If the slave address was not valid. Valid
 *        slave addresses are in the range 1 - 247.
 *    - eMBErrorCode::MB_EPORTERR IF the porting layer returned an error.
